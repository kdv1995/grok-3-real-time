# Difficult Node.js Tasks

## User Authentication System

Step 1: Initialize a Node.js project and install a web framework plus a database library (e.g., for MongoDB).
Step 2: Set up a database connection and create a simple user schema with fields like email and password.
Step 3: Install a library to securely hash passwords.
Step 4: Create endpoints for user registration (save email and hashed password) and login (verify credentials).
Step 5: Add session management or token-based authentication to track logged-in users.
Step 6: Test the system by registering a user, logging in, and securing a protected route.

## Real-Time Task Manager with Database

Step 1: Set up a Node.js project with a real-time library and a database package.
Step 2: Connect to a database and design a table or collection for tasks (e.g., with fields like title, status, and timestamp).
Step 3: Build a server with endpoints to add, update, and delete tasks, syncing changes to the database.
Step 4: Create a simple web interface to display tasks and allow user interaction.
Step 5: Use real-time updates to reflect changes (e.g., a new task) across all connected clients instantly.
Step 6: Test by adding tasks in one browser and confirming they appear in another.

## Web Scraper with Data Storage

Step 1: Initialize a Node.js project and install a web scraping library plus a database tool.
Step 2: Pick a target website with simple, scrape-friendly content (e.g., a news site).
Step 3: Write a script to fetch the siteâ€™s HTML and extract specific data, like headlines or links.
Step 4: Connect to a database and create a structure to store the scraped data.
Step 5: Save the extracted info into the database each time the script runs.
Step 6: Run the scraper, check the database, and ensure the data persists correctly.
