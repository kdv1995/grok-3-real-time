# Medium Node.js Tasks

## To-Do List API

Step 1: Set up a new Node.js project and install a web framework.
Step 2: Create a main file to handle your server logic.
Step 3: Define an in-memory list (like an array) to store to-do items temporarily.
Step 4: Set up three endpoints: one to list all tasks, one to add a task, and one to delete a task by its position.
Step 5: Test adding a task using a tool like Postman, then check the list, and finally delete it.
Step 6: Start the server and ensure all endpoints work as expected.

## Weather Data Fetcher

Step 1: Initialize a Node.js project and install a package to make HTTP requests.
Step 2: Sign up for a free weather API service to get an API key.
Step 3: Create a script file to hold your logic.
Step 4: Write a function that takes a city name and uses the API key to request weather data.
Step 5: Display the temperature and conditions in the console based on the API response.
Step 6: Run the script with a sample city and verify the output.

## Basic Chat Server

Step 1: Set up a Node.js project and install a library for real-time communication (hint: think sockets).
Step 2: Create a server file to manage connections.
Step 3: Set up a simple client HTML file with a text input and message display area.
Step 4: Configure the server to broadcast messages to all connected users.
Step 5: Open multiple browser tabs to simulate different users and send messages.
Step 6: Start the server and test the chat functionality across tabs.
